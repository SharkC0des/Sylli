# Sylli

An app that automatically create google calendar events when users upload their syllabus/files with pivotal dates 

## Current Progress

- Only PDF files for now
- Events are created given a file
  - Works with one or more dates

## Next-Steps

- [ ] Analyze "Summary" or title of the documentation and include that in the events
- [ ] Further testing on same dates, different times

## Future ideas

- Build a UI that allows user to upload a file of any type 
- In-house calendar feature for the long term
  - Apple calendar in the short
